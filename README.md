### Description

This is one of the ONLY AI programs on PSC. The AI checkers engine is very advanced and almost unbeatable!! This is the follow-on to the multi-award winning version 2. V3 is faster, more intelligent and boasts a whole host of new options and features. You think you good at checkers? think again!! I've included a rather good paper on the minimax algorithm (written by Ulli) and a copy of the international checkers rules in the zip file.
 
### More Info
 
You don't need to know much about AI to really understand this program. The coding is complicated in some places but nothing the intermediate programmer can't handle!!
